# JSQL Project

This project introduces JSQL, a lightweight JSON-based SQL-like interface for managing data stored in JSON format. It provides a simple way to create tables, insert data, and query data using a syntax reminiscent of SQL.

## Features

- **Create Tables**: Easily define new tables for storing your data.
- **Insert Data**: Add data to your tables using a simple JSON format.
- **Query Data**: Retrieve data with conditions similar to SQL WHERE clauses.
- **Flush Database**: Clear all data from the database, resetting it.

## Getting Started

To get started with JSQL, clone this repository and ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, you can interact with the JSQL database through the provided CLI tool or by integrating the `JSQL` class into your Python projects.

### CLI Usage

1. Navigate to the CLI directory.
2. Run `python cli.py` to start the interactive command line interface.
3. Use commands like `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, and `SELECT * FROM` to manage your database.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the `cli.py` file or type `HELP` in the CLI.
